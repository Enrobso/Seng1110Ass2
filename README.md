I am Ephream Osborne and I'm a first year computer science student.
This is my second programming assignment in java. It is an extension of assignment one. However,
thiss program has arrays implemented. It holds up to 4 depots with up to 5 producrs in each
depot.
Another addition is importing and exporting a .txt file. The user can export a .txt file that 
contains all the depot and produxt information. They can also import a .txt file
with that information to the program. New depots and products will be added as written.
