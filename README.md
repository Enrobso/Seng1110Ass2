I am Ephream Osborne and I'm a first year computer science student.
This is my second programming assignment in java. It is an extension of assignment one. However,
thiss program has arrays implemented. It holds up to 4 depots with up to 5 products in each
depot.
Another addition is importing and exporting a .txt file. The user can export a .txt file that 
contains all the depot and produxt information. They can also import a .txt file
with that information to the program. New depots and products will be added as written.
Some minor features have also been added. If a user attempts to add a product with the same name from a different depot, the price and weigth will be taken from that existing product. The user will then just add a quantity.
If the product is the same as a product already existing in the depot, the user will just be asked to add a quantity that is added on to the existing quantity.
